## [Unreleased]

### SimulatorCameraEx の配布対応
- **アプリ名とバンドル ID を SimulatorCameraEx に変更。** `SimulatorCameraEx.app`、
  `jp.co.bluecode.SimulatorCameraEx`（拡張は `….SimulatorCameraEx.Extension`、App Group は
  `C5TUJ8526Z.jp.co.bluecode.SimulatorCameraEx`）。元の SimulatorCamera と同じ Mac に入れても
  ぶつかりません。旧 ID の拡張は別物として残るので、旧アプリで Deactivate してから削除します。
- **初めて拡張を有効化したあと、映像が届かなかった不具合を修正。** アプリ内のカメラ一覧が
  有効化前のまま更新されず、アプリを手動で再起動するまで仮想カメラにつながりませんでした。
  有効化の完了後3秒たっても仮想カメラが見えなければ、アプリが自動で再起動します。
- **Developer ID で配布できるアーカイブに修正。** `simcamctl` がアーカイブの
  `/usr/local/bin` にも入っていたため、Xcode がアプリのアーカイブと認識せず、配布方法を
  選べませんでした（`simcamctl` はアプリ内の `Contents/MacOS` にだけ入れます）。
- **リリース手順を追加。** `scripts/archive-release.sh`（アーカイブを作り Organizer で開く）と
  `scripts/package-dmg.sh`（公証済みのアプリから DMG・ZIP を作る）。署名と公証は Organizer の
  Direct Distribution で、クラウド管理の Developer ID 証明書を使います。手順は RELEASING.md。

### Changed
- **Frame transport rewritten on CoreMediaIO sink streams.** The v1.0.0 design
  pushed frames into the camera extension over a private `NSXPCListener`.
  Apple DTS classes that as unsupported (the extension runs as the
  `_cmiodalassistants` role user, so the app's Mach lookup never reaches it),
  and it never worked end-to-end. The extension now publishes a sink stream
  (`SimulatorCamera.Video.Sink`) next to the camera stream; the app and
  `simcamctl` open it through the CoreMediaIO C API and enqueue IOSurface-
  backed `CMSampleBuffer`s, which the extension re-sends on the camera stream
  without copying pixels. Control (source kind, status) travels as custom
  properties on the camera stream. `Shared/XPCContract.swift`,
  `XPCListener.swift` and `XPCClient.swift` are gone; `Shared/CameraContract.swift`,
  `Shared/CMIOSinkClient.swift` and `SimulatorCamera/CameraLink.swift` replace them.
- Virtual camera format is 1280x720 BGRA @ 30 fps (was 1920x1080 @ 60 with
  1280x720 payloads that never rendered). Every source is normalized to that
  geometry once, with a shared `CIContext` and pixel-buffer pool.
- Image, QR and simcamctl share one rasterizer (`FrameRaster`, `QRRenderer`)
  that draws straight into IOSurface-backed pixel buffers.
- `simcamctl status` shows sink state and the extension's received / rejected
  frame counters; `ping` confirms the device and its properties are reachable.
  Exit code 2 now means "virtual camera not registered".
- The container app declares `com.apple.security.device.camera` (needed to
  start a CMIO stream from the sandbox).

### Fixed
- **Test-pattern timer leak.** Each CMIO client that started streaming created
  a new timer without cancelling the previous one; orphaned timers kept emitting
  at full rate forever. Only the first client creates the timer now.
- **Host-clock timestamps.** Frames are stamped with the host clock on both
  sides; source-relative (sometimes negative) seconds no longer reach
  `UInt64` conversions.
- **Extension never stalls the consumer.** With a producer selected but quiet
  the last frame is re-sent with fresh timestamps; with none delivered yet the
  stripe pattern shows. Frames that arrive while the test pattern is selected
  are consumed and ignored, so a stray producer cannot override the choice.
- **Sink producers are gated** to binaries whose signing ID matches the
  extension's own bundle-ID prefix (`…SimulatorCamera`, `…simcamctl`).
- **Source switching is race-free.** Rapid switches are serialized by a
  generation counter; a camera that finishes warming up after a newer switch is
  stopped instead of leaking. The sink is opened before the producer starts and
  the extension learns the new source only once frames are flowing.
- **Camera link recovers on its own.** Device discovery retries with capped
  backoff and re-attaches on `AVCaptureDevice.wasConnectedNotification` (which
  fires when the extension registers). Status is polled once a second.
- **Video file source** cancels its reader on stop, stops instead of spinning
  on unreadable files, clamps negative PTS, and paces against the wall clock.
- **Mac camera source** honours a `stop()` that lands while the session is
  still starting, and never selects the virtual camera as its own input.
- Extension state is queried at launch (`propertiesRequest`) so a relaunched
  app shows "Active" instead of "Not checked". Leftover activation diagnostics
  that wrote files into `~/Library/Logs` are gone.

### Added
- `SimulatorCameraTests`: 20 logic tests for the contract, status encoding,
  frame validation, sink-client edge cases, raster helpers and QR rendering.
  CI runs them.
- Diagnostics in the UI: camera-link state, whether any app is capturing from
  the virtual camera, and frames dropped / rejected on both sides.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-26

**Architectural rewrite.** v1.0.0 abandons the v0.x TCP/SDK approach in
favor of Apple's `CMIOExtension` system extension. The iOS Simulator
(Xcode 16+) sees a real virtual camera through standard `AVFoundation`.
**No SDK to import. No `Info.plist` key required in your app. No
`#if targetEnvironment(simulator)` branches.**

### Added
- **macOS Camera Extension** (`SimulatorCameraExtension.systemextension`)
  bundled inside the container app, registers as "SimulatorCamera Virtual"
  in `AVCaptureDevice.devices(for: .video)`.
- **Container app** (`SimulatorCamera.app`) submits
  `OSSystemExtensionRequest` activation, hosts SwiftUI source picker,
  pumps frames into the extension over XPC.
- **Five frame sources:**
  - Test pattern (built into extension; works with no setup)
  - Mac webcam (`AVCaptureSession` on host)
  - Video file (`AVAssetReader`, MP4/MOV/HEVC, loops at EOF)
  - Static image (PNG/JPG, letterboxed to 1280x720)
  - QR code generator (any UTF-8 string)
- **`simcamctl` CLI** — `simcamctl set-source --qr "..."`,
  `--image PATH`, `--pattern`, `status`, `ping`. Useful for AI agents
  + CI that need deterministic frame fixtures.
- **`patches/` directory** — `patch-package`-compatible patches for
  `expo-camera < 55.0.11`, `react-native-vision-camera < 5.0`,
  `react-native-webrtc`, `@fishjam-cloud/react-native-webrtc`. These
  libraries hard-code `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)` to disable the
  camera; we patch around the guard.
- **XcodeGen project** (`project.yml`) — Xcode project regenerable from
  YAML, suitable for `git diff`-friendly review.
- **Run Diagnostics UI** in container app — XPC connection state,
  extension activation state, frame counter.

### Changed
- **Tagline:** "Stream a real camera into the iOS Simulator" → "Your
  Mac's camera, in the iOS Simulator. Free and open." Positions
  SimulatorCamera as Act 1 of the Simulator's missing sensor layer
  (microphone, BLE, motion, LiDAR coming in v2+).
- **Min macOS:** 13.0 (Ventura) → 14.0 (Sonoma) for `@Observable` +
  `@Environment(.self)` SwiftUI APIs.
- **Distribution:** arm64-only. Intel Macs not supported in v1.x.
- **Bundle ID:** `com.simulatorcamera.server` →
  `com.dautov.SimulatorCamera` (container) +
  `com.dautov.SimulatorCamera.Extension` (system extension).

### Removed
- **Entire iOS SDK** (`SimulatorCameraClient` Swift Package). The new
  architecture requires zero iOS SDK; user apps go through
  `AVFoundation` unchanged.
- **TCP server** (`SimulatorCameraServer` CLI). Replaced by the system
  extension's XPC interface.
- **SCMF wire protocol.** Frames now flow through Apple's
  `CMIOExtensionStream` infrastructure.
- **`SimulatorCameraSession`, `SimulatorCameraPreviewView`, `SimulatorCameraView`,
  `SimulatorCaptureSession`, `SimulatorCameraOutput`** — all v0.x SDK types
  gone. User code that imported `SimulatorCameraClient` must drop the
  import; the camera "just works" through standard AVFoundation.
- **iOS demo app** (`apps/iOSDemo/`). With no SDK, no demo is needed —
  any iOS Simulator app that uses `AVCaptureDevice` IS the demo.
- **`NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` requirement.** No more local
  network — XPC is in-process to the system extension.
- **SwiftPM `Package.swift`.** System extensions cannot be built by
  SwiftPM; the project is now Xcode-managed (XcodeGen → .xcodeproj).

### Migration from v0.2.x

If you were on v0.2.x, the upgrade is structural:

1. `brew upgrade --cask simulatorcamera` (cask now points at the new app)
2. Open SimulatorCamera, click Activate, click Allow in System Settings
3. **Remove `SimulatorCameraClient` from your iOS app's Package.swift**
4. **Remove all `import SimulatorCameraClient` lines from your code**
5. **Remove the `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` Info.plist key** (was
   the v0.2 silent-failure gotcha; no longer needed)
6. **Remove the `SimulatorCameraSession` / `SimulatorCameraView` /
   `SimulatorCaptureSession` usage** — your existing
   `AVCaptureSession`-based code is now the path.

Net effect: the migration deletes code from your app rather than adding it.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Full `AVCaptureSession` drop-in shim.** New `SimulatorCaptureSession`, `SimulatorCaptureDevice`, `SimulatorCaptureDeviceInput` types let existing camera-setup code port by prefixing each AVFoundation type with `Simulator`.
- `SimulatorCamera` top-level facade (`configure(host:port:)`, `start()`, `stop()`, `isActive`) — one entry point for the whole SDK.
- Internal `_Router` fan-out: a single network session drives N `SimulatorCameraOutput` / preview sinks.
- **Mac Camera source** in the companion app (`AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video)`) — pick between video file and live Mac webcam from the server UI.
- Homebrew cask formula + tap instructions for one-line install of the Mac companion app.
- `scripts/build-release.sh` — archive, codesign, notarize, staple, and package the Mac app as both `.dmg` and `.zip`.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — tag-driven release: builds artifacts, drafts GitHub Release, uploads the `.dmg` and `.zip`.
- `RELEASING.md` runbook.
- `FUNDING.yml` for GitHub Sponsors / Buy Me a Coffee.

### Changed
- README: Homebrew install path, donation badge, v0.2 feature matrix, new "Full AVCaptureSession drop-in" usage block.
- Package is stable on iOS 16 / macOS 13; no source-breaking changes from 0.1.0 — existing `SimulatorCameraSession` / `SimulatorCameraOutput` code compiles unchanged.

### Fixed
- `SimulatorCameraOutput`: replaced broken `objc_setAssociatedObject(_, String, …)` wiring with a typed `routerToken` — package now compiles cleanly.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-14

First public alpha.

### Added
- Monorepo layout with root SwiftPM `Package.swift`.
- `FrameSource` protocol + `SimulatorCameraSession` + `SimulatorCameraPreviewView`.
- Reference SCMF codec and stream decoder.
- Mac companion app with test-pattern source.
- iOS demo app with Vision rectangle-detection hook.
- Protocol spec ([docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md)), architecture overview, roadmap.
